          Mechanical seals are a type of dynamic sealing to prevent leakage
          along the power transmitting shaft of a rotating machine. The
          mechanical seals prevent the fluid (water or oil) from leaking to the
          external environment (the atmosphere or a body of water).
          <br />
          <br />
          The mechanical seal technology is a combination of mechanical
          engineering and physical properties. More specifically, the core of
          the mechanical seal technology is tribology (friction, wear and
          lubrication) used to control the face surfaces where the stationary
          and rotary rings rub (slide) against each other.
          <br />
          <br />
          The face materials where the stationary ring and the rotary ring rub
          against each other are the most important portions as a barrier to the
          fluid. If the clearance is too small, the friction increases,
          hindering the shaft motion or resulting in seal breakage. Conversely,
          if the clearance is too large, the liquid will leak. Consequently, it
          is necessary to control the clearance in the order of micrometers to
          prevent leakage, but at the same time ensuring lubrication by the
          fluid, thereby reducing the sliding torque and avoiding hindrance to
          the machines’ rotation.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mechanical seals with improved functionality will not only prevent the
          liquid or gas handled by a machine from leaking to the outside, but
          can also improve machine operating efficiency, thereby helping achieve
          energy saving and prevent environmental contamination. Moreover, in
          some cases, rotating machines handle media that, in the case of
          leakage, can lead to a dangerous accident. Therefore, mechanical seals
          are required to be highly reliable through manufacturing backed by
          solid engineering expertise.
          <br />
          <br />
          With Total Prime, it is possible to fit the pumps with mechanical
          seals from any supplier. You as the client determine which seal
          supplier you prefer. However, Total Prime can also assist you in
          finding a high-quality and durable solution.

          scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only
          five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,

          Quality, Efficiency, Reliable Chrome Plating on all metal surfaces!

          <br />
          Hard chrome is an electroplated surface finish that is also known as
          industrial hard chrome, functional chrome, and engineering chrome.
          When designing machine components, engineers often combine a base
          metal, or substrate, with a surface finish to achieve the quality,
          efficiency, and reliability desired in their product. Of the numerous
          hard coating surface finishes available, industrial hard chrome
          plating continues to be one of the most popular. Over the years, Total
          Prime has provided electroplating services for a wide assortment of
          applications in every industry imaginable. Examples hydraulic rods,
          cylinders, shafts, and numerous other components in various
          industries. What has defined our chrome plating services is the
          ability to hold tight tolerances when depositing chromium on all metal
          surfaces.
